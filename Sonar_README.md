# Sonar - Machine Learning Model for Sonar Dataset

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model that predicts the presence of a mine or a rock on the basis of sonar signals. The dataset used for training is the **Sonar Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to classify sonar signals into two categories: **Mine** and **Rock**.

The model is implemented in **Python** using **scikit-learn** and **Pandas**, and the notebook explores various machine learning algorithms to determine the best classifier for this problem.

## Project Structure

- `Sonar.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the model, dataset preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
  
## Dataset

The **Sonar Dataset** contains 208 instances of sonar signals, each represented by 60 features (continuous values). The labels for each signal are either **Mine** or **Rock**, indicating whether the sonar signal is detecting a mine or a rock.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, make sure to install the required libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Loading the Dataset**: 
   - The dataset is loaded using **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
   - Features are extracted and labels are separated.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using **train_test_split** from **scikit-learn**.
   - Scaling the features to ensure all features are on the same scale is done using **StandardScaler**.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - The notebook explores several classifiers such as **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Support Vector Machine**, and others.
   - Each model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and other performance metrics.

4. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Models are evaluated on the test set, and performance metrics such as accuracy are compared.
   - A final model is selected based on the evaluation metrics.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preethamgm/Sonar.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Sonar
```

3. Open the `Sonar.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sonar.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to apply machine learning techniques to classify sonar signals. The dataset and the techniques used in this project serve as a useful reference for classification problems with numerical features.
